----- Analysis -----
### Root Cause
- Multiple issues related to missing methods and classes in the application codebase.
- Incorrect command-line options being used in the Symfony console.

### Impacted Components
- `UserController` (missing `generateOtp` method).
- `AuthOtp` model (class does not exist).
- `AuthOtpController` (argument mismatch in `generateOtp` method).

### Severity
- High: The application is unable to execute critical functions related to OTP generation, which may affect user authentication and security.

### Immediate Fix Suggestions
- Verify and implement the `generateOtp` method in `UserController` and `AuthOtpController`.
- Ensure the `AuthOtp` model class exists and is correctly defined.
- Check the command-line options being used and correct the usage of the `--source` option.

### Longer-term Remediation
- Implement unit tests for controllers to ensure methods exist and function as expected.
- Establish a code review process to catch such issues before deployment.
- Maintain updated documentation for command-line options and application structure to prevent misuse.
