----- Analysis -----
### Root Cause
- The MySQL server is using the deprecated `mysql_native_password` authentication method, which will be removed in future releases.

### Impacted Components
- MySQL Server
- Apache Web Server (indirectly, if it relies on MySQL for authentication)

### Severity
- Medium: While the system continues to operate, the use of deprecated features poses a risk for future compatibility and security.

### Immediate Fix Suggestions
- Update MySQL user accounts to use `caching_sha2_password` instead of `mysql_native_password`.
- Review and update any application configurations that rely on `mysql_native_password`.

### Longer-term Remediation
- Plan for a migration strategy to fully transition to `caching_sha2_password` across all applications and services.
- Regularly review and update server configurations to avoid reliance on deprecated features.
- Monitor MySQL release notes for updates and deprecation timelines to stay ahead of potential issues.
